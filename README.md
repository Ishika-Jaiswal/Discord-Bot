# Discord-Bot
Objective: The objective of this project is to create a bot that sends positive and encouraging messages to users on a Discord server.

Features: The bot could have several features, such as:

-Sending a random motivational quote to a user when they request it.
-Sending daily or weekly motivational messages to all users on the server.
-Responding to specific trigger words or phrases with an appropriate motivational message.

Languages and Tools: To create the Discord encouragement bot, Python is used here along with libraries and tools such as the Discord.js or Discord.py libraries to interface with the Discord API.

Development Process: 

-Created a Discord bot account and obtain an API key.
-Set up the necessary programming environment and libraries.
-Implemented the basic functionality of the bot, such as responding to trigger words with predefined messages.
-Implemented the more complex features, such as sending random quotes or allowing users to subscribe to messages.
-Test the bot thoroughly to ensure it's working as intended.
-Deployed the bot using uptime robot, so it can run continuously.

Future Improvements: 
Integrating the bot with external APIs, such as a weather API, to provide more personalized messages.
Allowing users to customize the frequency or content of the motivational messages they receive.
Creating a leaderboard to track users who have received the most messages or have submitted the most motivational messages.
